/**
 * Given a binary array data, return the minimum number of swaps required to group all 1â€™s 
 * present in the array together in any place in the array.
  ex) data = [1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1], output: 3 swaps
  
 * Idea: Get the window size aka total number of 1's in array. Within this window, look at array
 * and find the max amount of 1's within any given window.
 * Difference btwn window size and max 1's is the min number of 0's to swap
 * 
 * Time: O(n) , Space: O(1)
